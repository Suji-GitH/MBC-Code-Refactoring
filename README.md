## Overview
Refactor an existing webpage (html and CSS) for Horiseon(stakeholder) so that it follows accessibility standards and be optimized for search engine. 

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## UI/UX Consideration (Assumption made that stakeholders agree on the design choices recommended)
Number of UI/UX design choices are made compared to the original website. 

1. "Seo" in Horiseon is changed to yellow so that it is more accessible to colour blind audience. 

2. Some break points and break line to show user some division to the areas. 

3. Benefits section has moved from being aside to below the main image content, this will highlight the benefits and user can focus on the section without being distracted by any other content besides it. The back ground colour is applied and text are kept black again making it more readable for colour blind audience and to break up the sections. 

4. Header colour palette is applied for Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing to keep it uniform throughout the page. Image all moved to the left so you eyes don't dart off at different section of the page and naturally will be reading from left to right.

5. Website is designed to be responsive and tablet and mobile friendly. 

## Process of Design

## Testing
